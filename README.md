CircleCi Orb for uploading Android applications to AppGallery.

This makes use of the [AppGallery Connect API](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agcapi-overview-0000001158245083) to upload your build android application to AppGallery. 

Note that you will need to have already build the APK or AAB file before using this upload orb.
